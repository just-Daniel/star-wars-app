Star Wars Character Explorer is a React Native mobile application that allows users to explore information about Star Wars characters. Users can view details about characters, like their name, birth year, height, mass, homeworld, and the movies they've appeared in. They can also like/unlike characters, which will add or remove them from the "Liked Characters" tab on the home screen.
